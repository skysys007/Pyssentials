# Pyssentials

## Overview
**Pyssentials** is a concise reference repository covering **essential Python concepts and libraries** required for **data extraction, analysis, pre-processing, and visualization** in Machine Learning workflows.

The repository is not intended to be a complete Python course. Instead, it focuses only on the **Python fundamentals and tools that are repeatedly used** when working with data and preparing it for ML tasks. It is designed for **quick reference and later review**.

## Scope of This Repository

### 1. Essential Python Concepts
Only Python features that are directly useful for data-related work:
- Core data types
- Conditional logic
- Loops
- Functions
- Basic file operations
- Writing readable and maintainable code

---

### 2. Essential Libraries for Data Work
Libraries commonly used in data and ML pipelines:
- **NumPy** for numerical computations
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** for visualization

Coverage is practical and example-driven, focusing on commonly used functions and methods.
